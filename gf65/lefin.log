WARNING (LEFPARS-2077): A SPACING SAMENET section is defined but it is not legal in a LEF 5.7 version file. It will be ignored which will probably cause real DRC violations to be ignored, and may cause false DRC violations to occur.  To avoid this warning, and correctly handle these DRC rules, you should modify your LEF to use the appropriate SAMENET keywords as described in the LEF/DEF 5.7 manual under the SPACING statements in the LAYER (Routing) and LAYER (Cut) sections listed in the LEF Table of Contents.
