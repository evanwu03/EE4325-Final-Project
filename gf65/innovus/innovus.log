**WARN: (IMPSYT-7328):	The design has been initialized in physical-only mode because the init_mmmc_file global variable was not defined. Timing analysis will not be possible within this session. You can only use commands that do not depend on timing data. If you need to use timing, you need to restart with an init_mmmc_file to define the timing setup, or you can save this design and use restoreDesign -mmmc_file <viewDef.tcl> to add the timing setup information.
